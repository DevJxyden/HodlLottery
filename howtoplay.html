<h3 style="text-align:center;">How to play The Hodl Lottery</H3>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<pre style="font-size:16px;">
The goal of Hodl Lottery is to be the last player remaining with a ticket in order to claim the winning prize.
Players begin by creating their own game for others to join or by buying tickets for an for an existing game.

Each game is broken down into a series of rounds where up to 8 tickets are randomly eliminated from the entry pool.
(Depending on how many tickets left in the game).
Between each round there is a waiting period before the next round can start. During this time, players can decide to
sell their own tickets to other players (for more money than they bought them for) or buy tickets from other players
even if they did not initially start in the game. In other words, players still in the game can decide to hold on to
their tickets and hope for the best, or sell them while they are still valuable and in the game.

Tickets that have been eliminated cannot be sold and are no longer valid in the game.
When there is only one ticket remaining, the [finish game] function can be executed by anybody and the winner 
of the game will receive the HPB in the prize pool which is equal to 98% of the ticket costs with 2% being sent to 
the developer for future projects.

Step by Step
1.) (Optional) Set An Alias to appear as your name instead of your wallet address.
2.) Deposit HPB into your In-Game Account.
3.) Create a new game or buy tickets for an existing game
4.)The advanced menu in create game allows you to customize the delay between rounds and before the game starts.
5.) Wait for enough tickets to be bought from players in order to start the game and also wait the necessary
time in order to start the game.
6.)wait for the "action delay" to expire to be able to start the game, this gives time for other players to join.
More tickets can be bought then the the minimum set but needs to meet the minimum before starting the game.
7.) Start the game.
8.) Wait to be able to start the next round, anybody can sell any number of their valid tickets or buy 
tickets from others during this time in the exchange in the action menu, this is useful in larger games.
9.)Continue starting the rounds until there is only 1 ticket remaining
10.) Claim the reward.

<h3 style="text-align:center;">FAQ</H3>
<HR>
<pre style="font-size:16px;">

Q.)Something is wrong with Metamask and now I can't do any transactions from my account.
What do I do?
A.)If you are unable to cancel a transaction that is stuck in Metamask, 
load the account in the official HPB wallet and perform a transaction from there to reset the account.
Make sure to always use the minimum gas price of 18gwei.

Q.) Why does this game require metamask?
A.)The game data is 100% stored on the HPB blockchain and metamask is a interface that allows you 
to interact with the blockchain seemlessly without revealing your private key to third parties. 
Transactions can be seen in real-time in the game window interface.

Q.)Why can I only buy 8 tickets at a time?
A.)This was done intentionally to optimize gas costs for transactions.

Q.)I'm trying to perform an action and metamask is saying it will cost me a huge amount of gas,
what's the problem'?
A.)This transaction will probably fail because a condition is not met and is a bug, please report
it to me on telegram @jxyden

Q.)Will you have more projects?
A.)If this project is used by enough people then there will be more development in the future.
